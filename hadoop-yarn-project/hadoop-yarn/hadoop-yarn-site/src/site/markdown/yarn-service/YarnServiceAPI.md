# YARN Service API 

Bringing a new service on YARN today is not a simple experience. The APIs of existing
frameworks are either too low level (native YARN), require writing new code (for frameworks with programmatic APIs)
or writing a complex spec (for declarative frameworks).

This simplified REST API can be used to create and manage the lifecycle of YARN services.
In most cases, the application owner will not be forced to make any changes to their applications.
This is primarily true if the application is packaged with containerization technologies like Docker.

This document describes the API specifications (aka. YarnFile) for deploying/managing
containerized services on YARN. The same JSON spec can be used for both REST API
and CLI to manage the services.

## Paths
### Create a service
```
POST /app/v1/services
```

#### Description

Create a service. The request JSON is a service object with details required for creation. If the request is successful it returns 202 Accepted. A success of this API only confirms success in submission of the service creation request. There is no guarantee that the service will actually reach a RUNNING state. Resource availability and several other factors determines if the service will be deployed in the cluster. It is expected that clients would subsequently call the GET API to get details of the service and determine its state.

### Update to modify the lifetime of a service
PUT URL - http://localhost:8088/app/v1/services/hello-world

##### PUT Request JSON

Note, irrespective of what the current lifetime value is, this update request will set the lifetime of the service to be 3600 seconds (1 hour) from the time the request is submitted. Hence, if a a service has remaining lifetime of 5 mins (say) and would like to extend it to an hour OR if an application has remaining lifetime of 5 hours (say) and would like to reduce it down to an hour, then for both scenarios you need to submit the same request below.

```json
{
  "lifetime": 3600
}
```
### Stop a service
PUT URL - http://localhost:8088/app/v1/services/hello-world

##### PUT Request JSON
```json
{
  "state": "STOPPED"
}
```

### Start a service
PUT URL - http://localhost:8088/app/v1/services/hello-world

##### PUT Request JSON

{
  "state": "STARTED"
}
```

### Update to flex up/down the number of containers (instances) of a component of a service
PUT URL - http://localhost:8088/app/v1/services/hello-world/components/hello

##### PUT Request JSON
```json
{
  "number_of_containers": 3
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify the entire "components" section instead.

PUT URL - http://localhost:8088/app/v1/services/hello-world
##### PUT Request JSON
```json
{
  "state": "FLEX",
  "components" :
    [
      {
        "name": "hello",
        "number_of_containers": 3
      }
    ]

##### GET Response JSON
GET URL - http://localhost:8088/app/v1/services/hello-world

Note, for an anti-affinity component no more than 1 container will be allocated
in a specific node. In this example, 3 containers have been requested by
component "hello". All 3 containers were allocated because the cluster had 3 or
more NMs. If the cluster had less than 3 NMs then less than 3 containers would
be allocated. In cases when the number of allocated containers are less than the
number of requested containers, the component and the service will be in
non-STABLE state.
