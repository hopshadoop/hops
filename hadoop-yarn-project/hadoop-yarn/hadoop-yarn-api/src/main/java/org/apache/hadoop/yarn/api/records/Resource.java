/**
 * <p><code>Resource</code> models a set of computer resources in the
 * cluster.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Currently it models both <em>memory</em> and <em>CPU</em>.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The unit for memory is megabytes. CPU is modeled with virtual cores
 * (vcores), a unit for expressing parallelism. A node's capacity should
 * be configured with virtual cores equal to its number of physical cores. A
 * container should be requested with the number of cores it can saturate, i.e.
 * the average number of threads it expects to have runnable at a time.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Virtual cores take integer values and thus currently CPU-scheduling is
 * very coarse.  A complementary axis for CPU requests that represents
 * processing
 * power will likely be added in the future to enable finer-grained resource
 * configuration.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Typically, applications request <code>Resource</code> of suitable
 * capability to run their component tasks.</p>
