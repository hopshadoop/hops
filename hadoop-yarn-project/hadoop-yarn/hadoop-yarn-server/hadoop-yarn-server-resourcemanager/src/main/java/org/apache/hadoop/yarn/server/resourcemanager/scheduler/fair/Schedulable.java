/**
 * A Schedulable represents an entity that can launch tasks, such as a job
 * or a queue. It provides a common interface so that algorithms such as fair
 * sharing can be applied both within a queue and across queues. There are
 * currently two types of Schedulables: JobSchedulables, which represent a
 * single job, and QueueSchedulables, which allocate among jobs in their queue.
 * <p/>
 * Separate sets of Schedulables are used for maps and reduces. Each queue has
 * both a mapSchedulable and a reduceSchedulable, and so does each job.
 * <p/>
 * A Schedulable is responsible for three roles:
 * 1) It can launch tasks through assignTask().
 * 2) It provides information about the job/queue to the scheduler, including:
 * - Demand (maximum number of tasks required)
 * - Number of currently running tasks
 * - Minimum share (for queues)
 * - Job/queue weight (for fair sharing)
 * - Start time and priority (for FIFO)
 * 3) It can be assigned a fair share, for use with fair scheduling.
 * <p/>
 * Schedulable also contains two methods for performing scheduling
 * computations:
 * - updateDemand() is called periodically to compute the demand of the various
 * jobs and queues, which may be expensive (e.g. jobs must iterate through all
 * their tasks to count failed tasks, tasks that can be speculated, etc).
 * - redistributeShare() is called after demands are updated and a
 * Schedulable's
 * fair share has been set by its parent to let it distribute its share among
 * the other Schedulables within it (e.g. for queues that want to perform fair
 * sharing among their jobs).
