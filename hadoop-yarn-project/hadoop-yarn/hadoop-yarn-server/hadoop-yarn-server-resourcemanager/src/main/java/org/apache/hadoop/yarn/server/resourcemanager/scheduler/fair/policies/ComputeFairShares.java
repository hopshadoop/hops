   * Given a set of Schedulables and a number of slots, compute their weighted
   * fair shares. The min and max shares and of the Schedulables are assumed to
   * be set beforehand. We compute the fairest possible allocation of shares to
   * the Schedulables that respects their min and max shares.
   * <p>
   * To understand what this method does, we must first define what weighted
   * fair sharing means in the presence of min and max shares. If there
   * were no minimum or maximum shares, then weighted fair sharing would be
   * achieved if the ratio of slotsAssigned / weight was equal for each
   * Schedulable and all slots were assigned. Minimum and maximum shares add a
   * further twist - Some Schedulables may have a min share higher than their
   * assigned share or a max share lower than their assigned share.
   * <p>
   * To deal with these possibilities, we define an assignment of slots as being
   * fair if there exists a ratio R such that: Schedulables S where S.minShare
   * {@literal >} R * S.weight are given share S.minShare - Schedulables S
   * where S.maxShare {@literal <} R * S.weight are given S.maxShare -
   * All other Schedulables S are assigned share R * S.weight -
   * The sum of all the shares is totalSlots.
   * <p>
   * We call R the weight-to-slots ratio because it converts a Schedulable's
   * weight to the number of slots it is assigned.
   * <p>
   * We compute a fair allocation by finding a suitable weight-to-slot ratio R.
   * To do this, we use binary search. Given a ratio R, we compute the number of
   * slots that would be used in total with this ratio (the sum of the shares
   * computed using the conditions above). If this number of slots is less than
   * totalSlots, then R is too small and more slots could be assigned. If the
   * number of slots is more than totalSlots, then R is too large.
   * <p>
   * We begin the binary search with a lower bound on R of 0 (which means that
   * all Schedulables are only given their minShare) and an upper bound computed
   * to be large enough that too many slots are given (by doubling R until we
   * use more than totalResources resources). The helper method
   * resourceUsedWithWeightToResourceRatio computes the total resources used with a
   * given value of R.
   * <p>
   * The running time of this algorithm is linear in the number of Schedulables,
   * because resourceUsedWithWeightToResourceRatio is linear-time and the number of
   * iterations of binary search is a constant (dependent on desired precision).
