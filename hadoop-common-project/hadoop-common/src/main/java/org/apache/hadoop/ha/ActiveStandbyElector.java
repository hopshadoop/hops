/**
 * 
 * This class implements a simple library to perform leader election on top of
 * Apache Zookeeper. Using Zookeeper as a coordination service, leader election
 * can be performed by atomically creating an ephemeral lock file (znode) on
 * Zookeeper. The service instance that successfully creates the znode becomes
 * active and the rest become standbys. <br/>
 * This election mechanism is only efficient for small number of election
 * candidates (order of 10's) because contention on single znode by a large
 * number of candidates can result in Zookeeper overload. <br/>
 * The elector does not guarantee fencing (protection of shared resources) among
 * service instances. After it has notified an instance about becoming a leader,
 * then that instance must ensure that it meets the service consistency
 * requirements. If it cannot do so, then it is recommended to quit the
 * election. The application implements the {@link ActiveStandbyElectorCallback}
 * to interact with the elector
