# The S3N Client

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=0|toDepth=5} -->

S3N was a Hadoop filesystem client which can read or write data stored
in Amazon S3. It uses URLs with the schema `s3n://`.

**Hadoop's S3N client for Amazon S3 has been superceded by
the S3A connector**

**Please upgrade to S3A for a supported, higher-performance S3 Client**

## <a name="migrating"></a> How to migrate to to the S3A client

1. Keep the `hadoop-aws` JAR on your classpath.

1. Add the `aws-java-sdk-bundle.jar` JAR which Hadoop ships
with to your classpath.

1. Change the authentication keys

    | old key | new key |
    |---------|---------|
    | `fs.s3n.awsAccessKeyId` | `fs.s3a.access.key` |
    | `fs.s3n.awsSecretAccessKey` | `fs.s3a.secret.key` |

    Do make sure the property names are correct. For S3A, they are
    `fs.s3a.access.key` and `fs.s3a.secret.key` â€”you cannot just copy the S3N
    properties and replace `s3n` with `s3a`.

1. Replace URLs which began with `s3n://` with `s3a://`

1. You may now remove the `jets3t` JAR, as it is no longer needed.
